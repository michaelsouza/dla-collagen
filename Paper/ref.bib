of pointed tips appearing successively at the two ends of an axis-symmetric shaft with constant diameter.
Those tips, respectively fine (α) or coarse (β) have opposite molecular orientations. The α-pointed tips,
the first to appear, are particularly remarkable as they all show, on most of their length, a common
parabolic profile which stays constant during the growth. Assuming that the latter occurs by lateral
accretion of individual molecules in staggered configuration, we propose to give account of this prominent
morphological feature along a purely geometrical argument, the profile of a tip being linked to the shape
of the trajectories followed all along the accretion process. Among several possible trajectories, Fermat
spirals lead to a parabolic profile in perfect agreement with the one observed for α-pointed tips. This is to
be put in relation with the presence of such spirals in phyllotactic patterns which ensure the best packing
efficiency in cases of axis-symmetry, which is indeed that of dense collagen fibrils. Moreover, those patterns
are structured by concentric circles of dislocations, constitutive of the structure itself, whose behaviour
might contribute to the mechanical properties of the fibrils.}

The process of fibril formation, termed fibrillogenesis, is driven by the increase in entropy associated with loss of water from the bound monomers. A model based on diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) was used to investigate some of the mechanisms involved in this process. The aggregates created in the model displayed several features in common with collagen fibrils including an elongated morphology and a preference for tip growth. Analysis of these aggregates revealed a linear relationship between mass and distance from the tip, consistent with experimental observations. Intrafibrillar fluidity was introduced into the model by using a surface diffusion term. This led to the formation of aggregates with more compact morphologies. These results strongly implicate the role of diffusion limited growth in collagen fibril formation.}

In this paper, we examine the relationship between the fine structure of a collagen fibril and its relative tensile strength. Collagen is a fibrous protein which provides associated tissues with the majority of their tensile strength. It is present in the form of elongated structures termed fibrils which are created by the self-assembly of rod-like collagen molecules in an entropy-driven process termed fibrillogenesis. Mutations that alter the primary structure of the collagen molecule, interfere with this assembly process and can lead to the potentially fatal brittle bone disease, osteogenesis imperfecta. Here we investigate the mechanical properties of a range of computer-generated aggregates. The aggregates, created by the diffusion limited aggregation of rods, were subjected to a simple tensile test based on local rules of damage accumulation. In the test, core samples are ‘extracted’ from the aggregates, and the network of particles involved in the transmission of stress resolved. Increasing stress applied to the core leads to the removal of individual rods from this network; the tensile strength is determined from the force necessary to form a discontinuous network. Using this approach, we have shown that collagen fibril morphology is critical in determining its tensile strength. We suggest a possible mechanism to account for the increasing severity of osteogenesis imperfecta associated with the distance of mutation from the N-terminal of the collagen molecule.}

  journal = {Journal of Biological Chemistry},
  abstract = {Type I procollagen was purified from the medium of cultured human fibroblasts incubated with 14C-labeled amino acids, the NH2-terminal propeptides were cleaved with procollagen N-proteinase, and the resulting pC-collagen was isolated by gel filtration chromatography. pC-collagen did not assemble into fibrils or large aggregates even at concentrations of 0.5 mg.ml-1 at 34 degrees C in a physiological buffer. However, cleavage of pC-collagen to collagen with purified C-proteinase (Hojima, Y., (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15996-16003) generated fibrils that were visible by eye and that were large enough to be separated from solution by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 4 min. With high concentrations of enzyme, the pC-collagen was completely cleaved in 1 h, and turbidity was near maximal in 3 h, but collagen continued to be incorporated in fibrils for over 10 h. Because the pC-collagen was uniformly labeled with 14C-aminoacids, the concentration of soluble collagen and, therefore, the critical concentration of polymerization were determined directly. The critical concentration was independent of the initial pC-collagen concentration and of the rate of cleavage. The critical concentration decreased with temperature between 29 and 41 degrees C and was 0.12 +/- 0.06 (S.E.) microgram.ml-1 at 41 degrees C. The thermodynamic parameters of assembly were essentially independent of temperature in the range 29 to 41 degrees C. The process was endothermic with a delta H value of +56 kcal.mol-1, but entropy driven with a delta S value of +220 cal.K-1.mol-1. The Gibbs energy change for polymerization was -13 kcal.mol-1 at 37 degrees C. The data demonstrate, for the first time, that type I collagen fibril formation de novo is a classical example of an entropy-driven self-assembly process similar to the polymerization of actin, flagella, and tobacco mosaic virus protein.}

Single collagen fibrils immersed in PBS buffer were attached between an AFM cantilever and a glass surface to perform tensile tests at different strain rates and stress relaxation measurements. The stress–strain behavior of collagen fibrils immersed in PBS buffer comprises a toe region up to a stress of 5 MPa, followed by the heel and linear region at higher stresses. Hysteresis and strain-rate dependent stress–strain behavior of collagen fibrils were observed, which suggest that single collagen fibrils have viscoelastic properties. The stress relaxation process of individual collagen fibrils could be best fitted using a two-term Prony series. Furthermore, the influence of different cross-linking agents on the mechanical properties of single collagen fibrils was investigated. Based on these results, we propose that sliding of microfibrils with respect to each other plays a role in the viscoelastic behavior of collagen fibrils in addition to the sliding of collagen molecules with respect to each other. Our finding provides a better insight into the relationship between the structure and mechanical properties of collagen and the micro-mechanical behavior of tissues.}

A theoretical model relating the intermolecular space to X-ray diffraction parameters has been presented, and this suggests that the geometry of the intermolecular space arises from a near-hexagonal packing of the collagen molecules. On the basis of an assumed microfibrillar packing model and a geometric construction of the shape of a collagen molecule, the distribution of the space within reconstituted collagen fibrils has been characterized as follows: 0.13 ml of the intermolecular space/g collagen can be attributed to the helical groove of the collagen molecules per se and 1.01 ml/g is interstitial; 0.66 ml/g is present in the form of “pores” (hexagonally-closed packed spaces), whereas 0.48 ml/g is present in the form of “holes” (hexagonal volume defects); 0.73 ml/g of the intermolecular space is associated with a region of the collagen fibrils where holes are localized and 0.41 ml/g is attributable to the regions of the fibril in which pores only are present.}

In particular, the first crystal structure has clearly shown the highly ordered hydration network critical for stabilizing both the molecular conformation and the interactions between triple helices. The sequence dependent nature of the conformational features is also under active investigation by NMR and other techniques. The triple-helix motif has now been identified in proteins other than collagens, and it has been established as being important in many specific biological interactions as well as being a structural element. The nature of recognition and the degree of specificity for interactions involving triple helices may differ from globular proteins. Triple helix binding domains consist of linear sequences along the helix, making them amenable to characterization by simple model peptides. The application of structural techniques to such model peptides can serve to clarify the interactions involved in triple-helix recognition and binding and can help explain the varying impact of different structural alterations found in mutant collagens in diseased states.}

The fibrils were deposited on glass substrates that are partly coated with Teflon AF®. A modified AFM tip was used to accurately deposit epoxy glue droplets on either end of the collagen fibril that cross the glass-Teflon AF® interface, as to such attach it with one end to the glass and the other end to the AFM tip. Single collagen fibrils have been mechanically tested in ambient conditions and were found to behave reversibly up to stresses of 90 MPa. Within this regime a Young's modulus of 2–7 GPa was obtained. In aqueous media, the collagen fibrils could be tested reversibly up to about 15 MPa, revealing Young's moduli ranging from 0.2 to at most 0.8 GPa.},

               region missing one-fifth of the molecules in the cross-section
               compared to the overlap region. This leads to the gap region
               having a positive potential and the overlap region a negative
               potential with respect to an n-doped silicon probe as observed
               by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. In this study, we use the
               adhesion force between an n-doped silicon probe and a collagen
               substrate to demonstrate the sensitivity of adhesion force
               towards charge distribution on the surface of collagen fibrils.
               We also map the charge distribution at the surface of single in
               vivo and in vitro assembled collagen fibrils and characterize
               the three-dimensional location and strength of three sub D-band
               regions that have been observed previously by cryo-electron
               microscopy. Our approach provides an adhesion fingerprint unique
               to each fibril type we analyzed and points to local charge
               variations at the sub D-band level even along a single fibril.
               It opens the road for a detailed analysis of collagen fibrils
               surface modifications due to ligand binding or the accumulation
               of advanced glycation end products at sub D-band resolution on a
               fibril by fibril basis.",

abstract = {Collagen is a protein material with superior mechanical properties. It consists of collagen fibrils composed of a staggered array of ultra-long tropocollagen (TC) molecules. Theoretical and molecular modeling suggests that this natural design of collagen fibrils maximizes the strength and provides large energy dissipation during deformation, thus creating a tough and robust material. We find that the mechanics of collagen fibrils can be understood quantitatively in terms of two critical molecular length scales χS and χR that characterize when (i) deformation changes from homogeneous intermolecular shear to propagation of slip pulses and when (ii) covalent bonds within TC molecules begin to fracture, leading to brittle-like failure. The ratio χS/χR indicates which mechanism dominates deformation. Our modeling rigorously links the chemical properties of individual TC molecules to the macroscopic mechanical response of fibrils. The results help to explain why collagen fibers found in nature consist of TC molecules with lengths in the proximity of 300 nm and advance the understanding how collagen diseases that change intermolecular adhesion properties influence mechanical properties.}}

abstract = {Protein materials constitute Nature’s most intriguing material concepts, leading to multi-functional and stimuli responsive materials. Such materials often feature a characteristic hierarchical design, which is characterized by structural features starting at nanoscale. Here we review recent studies of deformation of collagen, Nature’s most abundant structural protein material forming the basis of bone, tendon and skin. We have discovered that a specific nanostructural design with molecular lengths of 200nm leads to the strongest possible ultra-structure that is still capable of dissipating large amounts of energy before fracture occurs, maximizing the toughness of the material [M.J. Buehler, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 103 (2006) 12285]. The analysis explains prevalent molecular length scales observed in tendon, bone and the eye’s cornea, and explains how molecular properties influence the deformation and fracture mechanics of tissues.}

abstract = {Collagen is a protein material with intriguing mechanical properties — it is highly elastic, shows large fracture strength and plays a crucial role in making Nature’s structural materials tough. Collagen based tissues consist of collagen fibrils, each of which is composed out of a staggered array of ultra-long tropocollagen molecules extending to several hundred nanometers. Albeit the macroscopic properties of collagen based tissues have been studied extensively, less is known about the nanomechanical properties of tropocollagen molecules and collagen fibrils, their elementary building blocks. In particular, the relationship between molecular properties and tissue properties remains a scarcely explored aspect of the science of collagen materials. Results of molecular multi-scale modeling of the nanomechanical properties of the large-strain deformation regime of collagen fibrils under varying cross-link densities are reported in this paper. The results confirm the significance of cross-links in collagen fibrils in improving its mechanical strength. Further, it is found that cross-links influence the nature of its large-deformation and fracture behavior. Cross-link deficient collagen fibrils show a highly dissipative deformation behavior with large yield regimes. Increasing cross-link densities lead to stronger fibrils that display an increasingly brittle deformation character. The simulation results are compared with recent nanomechanical experiments at the scale of tropocollagen molecules and collagen fibrils.}

  abstract = "Collagen fibrils are a very important component in most of the
              connective tissue in humans. An important process associated with
              several physiological and pathological states is the degradation
              of collagen. Collagen degradation is usually mediated by
              enzymatic and non-enzymatic processes. In this work we use
              molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of
              simulated degradation on the mechanical properties of the
              collagen fibril. We applied tensile stress to the collagen fiber
              at different stages of degradation. We compared the difference in
              the fibril mechanical priorities due the removal of enzymatic
              crosslink, surface degradation and volumetric degradation. As
              anticipated, our results indicated that, regardless of the
              degradation scenario, fibril mechanical properties is reduced.
              The type of degradation mechanism (crosslink, surface or
              volumetric) expressed differential effect on the change in the
              fibril stiffness. Our simulation results showed dramatic change
              in the fibril stiffness with a small amount of degradation. This
              suggests that the hierarchical structure of the fibril is a key
              component for the toughness and is very sensitive to changes in
              the organization of the fibril. The overall results are intended
              to provide a theoretical framework for the understanding the
              mechanical behavior of collagen fibrils under degradation.",

    abstract = "{Mineralized collagen fibrils are composed of tropocollagen molecules and mineral crystals derived from hydroxyapatite to form a composite material that combines optimal properties of both constituents and exhibits incredible strength and toughness. Their complex hierarchical structure allows collagen fibrils to sustain large deformation without breaking. In this study, we report a mesoscale model of a single mineralized collagen fibril using a bottom‐up approach. By conserving the three‐dimensional structure and the entanglement of the molecules, we were able to construct finite‐size fibril models that allowed us to explore the deformation mechanisms which govern their mechanical behavior under large deformation. We investigated the tensile behavior of a single collagen fibril with various intrafibrillar mineral content and found that a mineralized collagen fibril can present up to five different deformation mechanisms to dissipate energy. These mechanisms include molecular uncoiling, molecular stretching, mineral/collagen sliding, molecular slippage, and crystal dissociation. By multiplying its sources of energy dissipation and deformation mechanisms, a collagen fibril can reach impressive strength and toughness. Adding mineral into the collagen fibril can increase its strength up to 10 times and its toughness up to 35 times. Combining crosslinks with mineral makes the fibril stiffer but more brittle. We also found that a mineralized fibril reaches its maximum toughness to density and strength to density ratios for a mineral density of around 30\\%. This result, in good agreement with experimental observations, attests that bone tissue is optimized mechanically to remain lightweight but maintain strength and toughness. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {We study the enzymatic degradation of an elastic fiber under tension using an anisotropic random-walk model coupled with binding-unbinding reactions that weaken the fiber. The fiber is represented by a chain of elastic springs in series along which enzyme molecules can diffuse. Numerical simulations show that the fiber stiffness decreases exponentially with two distinct regimes. The time constant of the first regime decreases with increasing tension. Using a mean field calculation, we partition the time constant into geometrical, chemical and externally controllable factors, which is corroborated by the simulations. We incorporate the fiber model into a multiscale network model of the extracellular matrix and find that network effects do not mask the exponential decay of stiffness at the fiber level. To test these predictions, we measure the force relaxation of elastin sheets stretched to 20\% uniaxial strain in the presence of elastase. The decay of force is exponential and the time constant is proportional to the inverse of enzyme concentration in agreement with model predictions. Furthermore, the fragment mass released into the bath during digestion is linearly related to enzyme concentration that is also borne out in the model. We conclude that in the complex extracellular matrix, feedback between the local rate of fiber digestion and the force the fiber carries acts to attenuate any spatial heterogeneity of digestion such that molecular processes manifest directly at the macroscale. Our findings can help better understand remodeling processes during development or in disease in which enzyme concentrations and/or mechanical forces become abnormal.}}
