  journal = {The European Physical Journal E},
  abstract = {The length of type-I collagen fibrils in solution increases through the development and progress
of pointed tips appearing successively at the two ends of an axis-symmetric shaft with constant diameter.
Those tips, respectively fine (α) or coarse (β) have opposite molecular orientations. The α-pointed tips,
the first to appear, are particularly remarkable as they all show, on most of their length, a common
parabolic profile which stays constant during the growth. Assuming that the latter occurs by lateral
accretion of individual molecules in staggered configuration, we propose to give account of this prominent
morphological feature along a purely geometrical argument, the profile of a tip being linked to the shape
of the trajectories followed all along the accretion process. Among several possible trajectories, Fermat
spirals lead to a parabolic profile in perfect agreement with the one observed for α-pointed tips. This is to
be put in relation with the presence of such spirals in phyllotactic patterns which ensure the best packing
efficiency in cases of axis-symmetry, which is indeed that of dense collagen fibrils. Moreover, those patterns
are structured by concentric circles of dislocations, constitutive of the structure itself, whose behaviour
might contribute to the mechanical properties of the fibrils.}

  abstract = {Type I collagen is a rod-like protein which self-assembles in a regular array to form elongated fibrils. The process of fibril formation, termed fibrillogenesis, is driven by the increase in entropy associated with loss of water from the bound monomers. A model based on diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) was used to investigate some of the mechanisms involved in this process. The aggregates created in the model displayed several features in common with collagen fibrils including an elongated morphology and a preference for tip growth. Analysis of these aggregates revealed a linear relationship between mass and distance from the tip, consistent with experimental observations. Intrafibrillar fluidity was introduced into the model by using a surface diffusion term. This led to the formation of aggregates with more compact morphologies. These results strongly implicate the role of diffusion limited growth in collagen fibril formation.}

We show that DLA has no upper critical dimension. We apply scale invariance to study growth, gelation, and the structure factor of aggregates.}

  abstract = {Previous theoretical studies of the mechanical properties of tissues such as skin, bone and tendon, have used approaches based on composite materials and have tended to neglect the contribution of individual microscopic components. In this paper, we examine the relationship between the fine structure of a collagen fibril and its relative tensile strength. Collagen is a fibrous protein which provides associated tissues with the majority of their tensile strength. It is present in the form of elongated structures termed fibrils which are created by the self-assembly of rod-like collagen molecules in an entropy-driven process termed fibrillogenesis. Mutations that alter the primary structure of the collagen molecule, interfere with this assembly process and can lead to the potentially fatal brittle bone disease, osteogenesis imperfecta. Here we investigate the mechanical properties of a range of computer-generated aggregates. The aggregates, created by the diffusion limited aggregation of rods, were subjected to a simple tensile test based on local rules of damage accumulation. In the test, core samples are ‘extracted’ from the aggregates, and the network of particles involved in the transmission of stress resolved. Increasing stress applied to the core leads to the removal of individual rods from this network; the tensile strength is determined from the force necessary to form a discontinuous network. Using this approach, we have shown that collagen fibril morphology is critical in determining its tensile strength. We suggest a possible mechanism to account for the increasing severity of osteogenesis imperfecta associated with the distance of mutation from the N-terminal of the collagen molecule.}

  journal = {Journal of Biological Chemistry},
  abstract = {Type I procollagen was purified from the medium of cultured human fibroblasts incubated with 14C-labeled amino acids, the NH2-terminal propeptides were cleaved with procollagen N-proteinase, and the resulting pC-collagen was isolated by gel filtration chromatography. pC-collagen did not assemble into fibrils or large aggregates even at concentrations of 0.5 mg.ml-1 at 34 degrees C in a physiological buffer. However, cleavage of pC-collagen to collagen with purified C-proteinase (Hojima, Y., (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15996-16003) generated fibrils that were visible by eye and that were large enough to be separated from solution by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 4 min. With high concentrations of enzyme, the pC-collagen was completely cleaved in 1 h, and turbidity was near maximal in 3 h, but collagen continued to be incorporated in fibrils for over 10 h. Because the pC-collagen was uniformly labeled with 14C-aminoacids, the concentration of soluble collagen and, therefore, the critical concentration of polymerization were determined directly. The critical concentration was independent of the initial pC-collagen concentration and of the rate of cleavage. The critical concentration decreased with temperature between 29 and 41 degrees C and was 0.12 +/- 0.06 (S.E.) microgram.ml-1 at 41 degrees C. The thermodynamic parameters of assembly were essentially independent of temperature in the range 29 to 41 degrees C. The process was endothermic with a delta H value of +56 kcal.mol-1, but entropy driven with a delta S value of +220 cal.K-1.mol-1. The Gibbs energy change for polymerization was -13 kcal.mol-1 at 37 degrees C. The data demonstrate, for the first time, that type I collagen fibril formation de novo is a classical example of an entropy-driven self-assembly process similar to the polymerization of actin, flagella, and tobacco mosaic virus protein.}

Single collagen fibrils immersed in PBS buffer were attached between an AFM cantilever and a glass surface to perform tensile tests at different strain rates and stress relaxation measurements. The stress–strain behavior of collagen fibrils immersed in PBS buffer comprises a toe region up to a stress of 5 MPa, followed by the heel and linear region at higher stresses. Hysteresis and strain-rate dependent stress–strain behavior of collagen fibrils were observed, which suggest that single collagen fibrils have viscoelastic properties. The stress relaxation process of individual collagen fibrils could be best fitted using a two-term Prony series. Furthermore, the influence of different cross-linking agents on the mechanical properties of single collagen fibrils was investigated. Based on these results, we propose that sliding of microfibrils with respect to each other plays a role in the viscoelastic behavior of collagen fibrils in addition to the sliding of collagen molecules with respect to each other. Our finding provides a better insight into the relationship between the structure and mechanical properties of collagen and the micro-mechanical behavior of tissues.}

The diameter of tested 10 fibrils was 410±60 nm (Mean±S.D.). The stress-strain curves of these fibrils were almost linear. Their tensile strength and failure strain were 100±32 MPa and 34±11%, respectively.

The extent of the space has been assessed experimentally by an X-ray diffraction method and a new physical chemical technique, and found to be 1.14 ml per gram collagen. A theoretical model relating the intermolecular space to X-ray diffraction parameters has been presented, and this suggests that the geometry of the intermolecular space arises from a near-hexagonal packing of the collagen molecules. On the basis of an assumed microfibrillar packing model and a geometric construction of the shape of a collagen molecule, the distribution of the space within reconstituted collagen fibrils has been characterized as follows: 0.13 ml of the intermolecular space/g collagen can be attributed to the helical groove of the collagen molecules per se and 1.01 ml/g is interstitial; 0.66 ml/g is present in the form of “pores” (hexagonally-closed packed spaces), whereas 0.48 ml/g is present in the form of “holes” (hexagonal volume defects); 0.73 ml/g of the intermolecular space is associated with a region of the collagen fibrils where holes are localized and 0.41 ml/g is attributable to the regions of the fibril in which pores only are present.}

In particular, the first crystal structure has clearly shown the highly ordered hydration network critical for stabilizing both the molecular conformation and the interactions between triple helices. The sequence dependent nature of the conformational features is also under active investigation by NMR and other techniques. The triple-helix motif has now been identified in proteins other than collagens, and it has been established as being important in many specific biological interactions as well as being a structural element. The nature of recognition and the degree of specificity for interactions involving triple helices may differ from globular proteins. Triple helix binding domains consist of linear sequences along the helix, making them amenable to characterization by simple model peptides. The application of structural techniques to such model peptides can serve to clarify the interactions involved in triple-helix recognition and binding and can help explain the varying impact of different structural alterations found in mutant collagens in diseased states.}
