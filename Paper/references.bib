               collagen type I and III are the most abundant, while collagen
               type VII is associated with pathologies of the dermal-epidermal

               majority of collagen is extracted from animal sources; however,
               animal-derived collagen has a number of shortcomings, including
               immunogenicity, batch-to-batch variation, and pathogenic

  author    = {Chen, Shoujun and Mienaltowski, Michael J and Birk, David E},
  abstract  = {The transparent cornea is the major refractive element of the
               eye. A finely controlled assembly of the stromal extracellular
               matrix is critical to corneal function, as well as in
               establishing the appropriate mechanical stability required to
               maintain corneal shape and curvature. In the stroma,
               homogeneous, small diameter collagen fibrils, regularly packed
               with a highly ordered hierarchical organization, are essential
               for function. This review focuses on corneal stroma assembly and
               the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis. Corneal collagen
               fibrillogenesis involves multiple molecules interacting in
               sequential steps, as well as interactions between keratocytes
               and stroma matrix components. The stroma has the highest
               collagen V:I ratio in the body. Collagen V regulates the
               nucleation of protofibril assembly, thus controlling the number
               of fibrils and assembly of smaller diameter fibrils in the
               stroma. The corneal stroma is also enriched in small
               leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) that cooperate in a temporal
               and spatial manner to regulate linear and lateral collagen
               fibril growth. In addition, the fibril-associated collagens
               (FACITs) such as collagen XII and collagen XIV have roles in the
               regulation of fibril packing and inter-lamellar interactions. A
               communicating keratocyte network contributes to the overall and
               long-range regulation of stromal extracellular matrix assembly,
               by creating micro-domains where the sequential steps in stromal
               matrix assembly are controlled. Keratocytes control the
               synthesis of extracellular matrix components, which interact
               with the keratocytes dynamically to coordinate the regulatory
               steps into a cohesive process. Mutations or deficiencies in
               stromal regulatory molecules result in altered interactions and
               deficiencies in both transparency and refraction, leading to
               corneal stroma pathobiology such as stromal dystrophies, cornea
               plana and keratoconus.},

  abstract  = {The length of type-I collagen fibrils in solution increases
               through the development and progress of pointed tips appearing
               successively at the two ends of an axis-symmetric shaft with
               constant diameter. Those tips, respectively fine ([Formula: see
               text]) or coarse ([Formula: see text]) have opposite molecular
               orientations. The [Formula: see text]-pointed tips, the first to
               appear, are particularly remarkable as they all show, on most of
               their length, a common parabolic profile which stays constant
               during the growth. Assuming that the latter occurs by lateral
               accretion of individual molecules in staggered configuration, we
               propose to give account of this prominent morphological feature
               along a purely geometrical argument, the profile of a tip being
               linked to the shape of the trajectories followed all along the
               accretion process. Among several possible trajectories, Fermat
               spirals lead to a parabolic profile in perfect agreement with
               the one observed for [Formula: see text]-pointed tips. This is
               to be put in relation with the presence of such spirals in
               phyllotactic patterns which ensure the best packing efficiency
               in cases of axis-symmetry, which is indeed that of dense
               collagen fibrils. Moreover, those patterns are structured by
               concentric circles of dislocations, constitutive of the

               with a characteristic axial periodic structure. The fibrils
               provide the major biomechanical scaffold for cell attachment and
               anchorage of macromolecules, allowing the shape and form of
               tissues to be defined and maintained. How the fibrils are formed
               from their monomeric precursors is the primary concern of this
               review. Collagen fibril formation is basically a self-assembly
               process (i.e. one which is to a large extent determined by the
               intrinsic properties of the collagen molecules themselves) but
               it is also sensitive to cell-mediated regulation, particularly
               in young or healing tissues. Recent attention has been focused
               on `early fibrils' or `fibril segments' of ~10 $\mu$m in length
               which appear to be intermediates in the formation of mature
               fibrils that can grow to be hundreds of micrometres in length.
               Data from several laboratories indicate that these early fibrils
               can be unipolar (with all molecules pointing in the same
               direction) or bipolar (in which the orientation of collagen
               molecules reverses at a single location along the fibril). The
               occurrence of such early fibrils has major implications for
               tissue morphogenesis and repair. In this article we review the
               current understanding of the origin of unipolar and bipolar
               fibrils, and how mature fibrils are assembled from early
               fibrils. We include preliminary evidence from invertebrates
               which suggests that the principles for bipolar fibril assembly
               were established at least 500 million years ago.},

              constituting about 30\% of the entire protein mass. Through a

              into high aspect-ratio fibers of tens to hundreds of nanometer
              diameter, known as collagen fibrils (CFs). In the last decade,
              several methods for tensile testing these CFs emerged. However,
              these methods are either overly time-consuming or offer low data
              acquisition bandwidth, rendering dynamic investigation of tensile
              properties impossible. Here, we describe a novel instrument for
              tensile testing of individual CFs. CFs are furnished with
              magnetic beads using a custom magnetic tweezer. Subsequently, CFs
              are lifted by magnetic force, allowing them to be picked-up by a
              microgripper structure, which is mounted on a cantilever-based
              interferometric force probe. A piezo-lever actuator is used to
              apply tensile displacements and to perform tensile tests of
              tethered CFs, after alignment. Once the mechanical tests are
              finished, CFs are removed from the microgripper by application of
              a magnetic field. Our novel instrument enables tensile tests with
              at least 25-fold increased throughput compared to tensile testing
              with an atomic force microscope while achieving force resolution

  title     = {Effects of maturation and advanced glycation on tensile
               mechanics of collagen fibrils from rat tail and Achilles tendons},
  author    = {Svensson, Rene B and Smith, Stuart T and Moyer, Patrick J and
               Magnusson, S Peter},
  abstract  = {Connective tissues are ubiquitous throughout the body and
               consequently affect the function of many organs. In load bearing
               connective tissues like tendon, the mechanical functionality is
               provided almost exclusively by collagen fibrils that in turn are
               stabilized by covalent cross-links. Functionally distinct
               tendons display different cross-link patterns, which also change
               with maturation, but these differences have not been studied in
               detail at the fibril level. In the present study, a custom built
               nanomechanical test platform was designed and fabricated to
               measure tensile mechanics of individual fibrils from rat
               tendons. The influence of animal maturity (4 vs. 16 week old
               rats) and functionally different tendons (tail vs. Achilles
               tendons) were examined. Additionally the effect of methylglyoxal
               (MG) treatment in vitro to form advanced glycation end products
               (AGEs) was investigated. Age and tissue type had no significant
               effect on fibril mechanics, but MG treatment increased strength
               and stiffness without inducing brittleness and gave rise to a
               distinct three-phase mechanical response corroborating that
               previously reported in human patellar tendon fibrils. That age
               and tissue had little mechanical effect, tentatively suggest
               that variations in enzymatic cross-links may play a minor role
               after initial tissue formation.Tendons are connective tissues
               that connect muscle to bone and carry some of the greatest
               mechanical loads in the body, which makes them common sites of
               injury. A tendon is essentially a biological rope formed by thin
               strands called fibrils made of the protein collagen. Tendon
               function relies on the strength of these fibrils, which in turn
               depends on naturally occurring cross-links between collagen
               molecules, but the mechanical influence of these cross-links
               have not been measured before. It is believed that beneficial
               cross-linking occurs with maturation while additional
               cross-linking with aging may lead to brittleness, but this study
               provides evidence that maturation has little effect on
               mechanical function and that age-related cross-linking does not
               result in brittle collagen fibrils.},

               vertebrate animals and compose a structural framework that
               provides mechanical support to load-bearing tissues.
               Understanding how these fibrils initially form and mechanically
               function has been the focus of a myriad of detailed
               investigations over the last few decades. From these studies a
               great amount of knowledge has been acquired as well as a number
               of new questions to consider. In this review, we examine the
               current state of our knowledge of the mechanical properties of
               extant fibrils. We emphasize on the mechanical response and
               related deformation of collagen fibrils upon tension, which is
               the predominant load imposed in most collagen-rich tissues. We
               also illuminate the gaps in knowledge originating from the
               intriguing results that the field is still trying to interpret.
               STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Collagen is the result of millions of
               years of biological evolution and is a unique family of
               proteins, the majority of which provide mechanical support to
               biological tissues. Cells produce collagen molecules that
               self-assemble into larger structures, known as collagen fibrils.
               As simple as they appear under an optical microscope, collagen
               fibrils display a complex ultrastructural architecture tuned to
               the external forces that are imposed upon them. Even more
               complex is the way collagen fibrils deform under loading, and
               the nature of the mechanisms that drive their formation in the
               first place. Here, we present a cogent synthesis of the
               state-of-knowledge of collagen fibril mechanics. We focus on the
               information we have from in vitro experiments on individual,
               isolated from tissues, collagen fibrils and the knowledge
               available from in silico tests.},

               properties. It consists of collagen fibrils composed of a
               staggered array of ultra-long tropocollagen (TC) molecules.
               Theoretical and molecular modeling suggests that this natural
               design of collagen fibrils maximizes the strength and provides
               large energy dissipation during deformation, thus creating a
               tough and robust material. We find that the mechanics of
               collagen fibrils can be understood quantitatively in terms of
               two critical molecular length scales chi(S) and chi(R) that
               characterize when (i) deformation changes from homogeneous
               intermolecular shear to propagation of slip pulses and when (ii)
               covalent bonds within TC molecules begin to fracture, leading to
               brittle-like failure. The ratio chi(S)/chi(R) indicates which
               mechanism dominates deformation. Our modeling rigorously links
               the chemical properties of individual TC molecules to the
               macroscopic mechanical response of fibrils. The results help to
               explain why collagen fibers found in nature consist of TC
               molecules with lengths in the proximity of 300 nm and advance
               the understanding how collagen diseases that change

               Albeit the macroscopic properties of collagen based tissues have
               been studied extensively, less is known about the nanomechanical
               properties of tropocollagen molecules and collagen fibrils,

               fibrils to sustain large deformation without breaking. In this
               study, we report a mesoscale model of a single mineralized
               collagen fibril using a bottom-up approach. By conserving the
               three-dimensional structure and the entanglement of the
               molecules, we were able to construct finite-size fibril models
               that allowed us to explore the deformation mechanisms which
               govern their mechanical behavior under large deformation. We
               investigated the tensile behavior of a single collagen fibril
               with various intrafibrillar mineral content and found that a
               mineralized collagen fibril can present up to five different
               deformation mechanisms to dissipate energy. These mechanisms
               include molecular uncoiling, molecular stretching,
               mineral/collagen sliding, molecular slippage, and crystal
               dissociation. By multiplying its sources of energy dissipation
               and deformation mechanisms, a collagen fibril can reach
               impressive strength and toughness. Adding mineral into the
               collagen fibril can increase its strength up to 10 times and its
               toughness up to 35 times. Combining crosslinks with mineral
               makes the fibril stiffer but more brittle. We also found that a
               mineralized fibril reaches its maximum toughness to density and
               strength to density ratios for a mineral density of around 30\%.
               This result, in good agreement with experimental observations,

               binding-unbinding reactions that weaken the fiber. The fiber is
               represented by a chain of elastic springs in series along which
               enzyme molecules can diffuse. Numerical simulations show that
               the fiber stiffness decreases exponentially with two distinct
               regimes. The time constant of the first regime decreases with
               increasing tension. Using a mean field calculation, we partition
               the time constant into geometrical, chemical and externally
               controllable factors, which is corroborated by the simulations.
               We incorporate the fiber model into a multiscale network model
               of the extracellular matrix and find that network effects do not
               mask the exponential decay of stiffness at the fiber level. To
               test these predictions, we measure the force relaxation of
               elastin sheets stretched to 20\% uniaxial strain in the presence
               of elastase. The decay of force is exponential and the time
               constant is proportional to the inverse of enzyme concentration

               mass released into the bath during digestion is linearly related
               to enzyme concentration that is also borne out in the model. We

              with a focus on potential implications for emphysema, a condition
              associated with collagen degradation and alveolar wall rupture.
              Tensile tests were conducted on individual collagen fibers
              isolated from bovine lung tissue. The rate of degradation was
              characterized by the change in fiber Young's modulus during 60
              min of digestion under various mechanical conditions mimicking
              the mechanical stresses on the fibers during breathing. Compared
              to digestion without mechanical forces, a significantly larger
              drop of fiber modulus was observed in the presence of static or
              intermittent mechanical forces. Fiber yield stress was also
              reduced after digestion indicating compromised fiber failure. By
              incorporating fibril waviness obtained by scanning electron

               regular array to form elongated fibrils. The process of fibril
               formation, termed fibrillogenesis, is driven by the increase in
               entropy associated with loss of water from the bound monomers. A
               model based on diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) was used to
               investigate some of the mechanisms involved in this process. The
               aggregates created in the model displayed several features in
               common with collagen fibrils including an elongated morphology
               and a preference for tip growth. Analysis of these aggregates
               revealed a linear relationship between mass and distance from
               the tip, consistent with experimental observations.
               Intrafibrillar fluidity was introduced into the model by using a
               surface diffusion term. This led to the formation of aggregates
               with more compact morphologies. These results strongly implicate
               the role of diffusion limited growth in collagen fibril

               cleavage of pC-collagen to collagen with purified C-proteinase
               (Hojima, Y., (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15996-16003) generated
               fibrils that were visible by eye and that were large enough to
               be separated from solution by centrifugation at 13,000 x g for 4
               min. With high concentrations of enzyme, the pC-collagen was
               completely cleaved in 1 h, and turbidity was near maximal in 3
               h, but collagen continued to be incorporated in fibrils for over
               10 h. Because the pC-collagen was uniformly labeled with
               14C-aminoacids, the concentration of soluble collagen and,
               therefore, the critical concentration of polymerization were
               determined directly. The critical concentration was independent
               of the initial pC-collagen concentration and of the rate of
               cleavage. The critical concentration decreased with temperature
               between 29 and 41 degrees C and was 0.12 +/- 0.06 (S.E.)
               microgram.ml-1 at 41 degrees C. The thermodynamic parameters of
               assembly were essentially independent of temperature in the
               range 29 to 41 degrees C. The process was endothermic with a
               delta H value of +56 kcal.mol-1, but entropy driven with a delta
               S value of +220 cal.K-1.mol-1. The Gibbs energy change for

               important role in mechanical behavior of these tissues.
               Extensive experimental and theoretical studies have so far been

  abstract  = {Previous theoretical studies of the mechanical properties of
               tissues such as skin, bone and tendon, have used approaches
               based on composite materials and have tended to neglect the
               contribution of individual microscopic components. In this
               paper, we examine the relationship between the fine structure of
               a collagen fibril and its relative tensile strength. Collagen is
               a fibrous protein which provides associated tissues with the
               majority of their tensile strength. It is present in the form of
               elongated structures termed fibrils which are created by the
               self-assembly of rod-like collagen molecules in an
               entropy-driven process termed fibrillogenesis. Mutations that
               alter the primary structure of the collagen molecule, interfere
               with this assembly process and can lead to the potentially fatal
               brittle bone disease, osteogenesis imperfecta. Here we
               investigate the mechanical properties of a range of
               computer-generated aggregates. The aggregates, created by the
               diffusion limited aggregation of rods, were subjected to a
               simple tensile test based on local rules of damage accumulation.
               In the test, core samples are ``extracted' from the aggregates,
               and the network of particles involved in the transmission of
               stress resolved. Increasing stress applied to the core leads to
               the removal of individual rods from this network; the tensile
               strength is determined from the force necessary to form a
               discontinuous network. Using this approach, we have shown that
               collagen fibril morphology is critical in determining its
               tensile strength. We suggest a possible mechanism to account for
               the increasing severity of osteogenesis imperfecta associated
               with the distance of mutation from the N-terminal of the
               collagen molecule.},

               discrete plasticity damage in tendon collagen fibrils},
  author    = {Veres, Samuel P and Harrison, Julia M and Lee, J Michael},
  abstract  = {A critical feature of tendons and ligaments is their ability to
               resist rupture when overloaded, resulting in strains or sprains
               instead of ruptures. To treat these injuries more effectively,
               it is necessary to understand how overload affects the primary
               load-bearing elements of these tissues: collagen fibrils. We
               have investigated how repeated subrupture overload alters the
               collagen of tendons at the nanoscale. Using scanning electron
               microscopy to examine fibril morphology and hydrothermal
               isometric tension testing to look at molecular stability, we
               demonstrated that tendon collagen undergoes a progressive
               cascade of discrete plasticity damage when repeatedly
               overloaded. With successive overload cycles, fibrils develop an
               increasing number of kinks along their length. These
               kinks-discrete zones of plastic deformation known to contain
               denatured collagen molecules-are accompanied by a progressive
               and eventual total loss of D-banding along the surface of
               fibrils, indicating a loss of native molecular packing and
               further molecular denaturation. Thermal analysis of molecular
               stability showed that the destabilization of collagen molecules
               within fibrils is strongly related to the amount of strain
               energy dissipated by the tendon after yielding during tensile
               overload. These novel findings raise new questions about load
               transmission within tendons and their fibrils and about the
               interplay between crosslinking, strain-energy dissipation
               ability, and molecular denaturation within these structures.},

  abstract  = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity,
               including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in
               physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems
               composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For
               example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate
               in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes
               show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We
               hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex
               emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons.
               We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and
               acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field
               potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array.
               Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in
               cortical networks is described by equations that govern
               avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching
               process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of
               -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the
               critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter
               at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward
               networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our
               findings suggest that ``neuronal avalanches'' may be a generic
               property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity
               that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or
               wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may
               satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and
               network stability.},

               knowledge of the mechanisms that govern reinflation of collapsed

               ventilation strategies for combating respiratory problems. Here

               that the underlying fracture dynamics in these systems might
               display self-organized criticality4, implying that long-ranged
               correlations between fracture events lead to a scale-free

               knowledge of how load is transmitted between and within fibrils
               is limited. The presence of covalent enzymatic cross-links
               between collagen molecules is an important factor that has been
               shown to influence mechanical behavior of the tendons. To
               improve our understanding of how molecular bonds translate into
               tendon mechanics, we used an atomic force microscopy technique

               rat-tail tendons (RTTs), NaBH₄ reduced RTTs, and tail tendons of
               Zucker diabetic fat rats were tested. We found a characteristic
               three-phase stress-strain behavior in the human collagen
               fibrils. There was an initial rise in modulus followed by a
               plateau with reduced modulus, which was finally followed by an
               even greater increase in stress and modulus before failure. The
               RTTs also displayed the initial increase and plateau phase, but
               the third region was virtually absent and the plateau continued
               until failure. The importance of cross-link lability was
               investigated by NaBH₄ reduction of the rat-tail fibrils, which
               did not alter their behavior. These findings shed light on the

               ribbon-like structures coating the entire support. We call these
               novel collagen structures microribbons. High-resolution atomic
               force microscopy topographs show that subunits of these
               microribbons are built by fibrillar structures. The smallest
               units of these fibrillar structures have cross-sections of
               approximately 3 x 5nm, consistent with current models of
               collagen microfibril formation. By varying the pH and
               electrolyte of the buffer solution during the self-assembly
               process, the microfibril density and contacts formed within this
               network could be controlled. Under certain electrolyte
               compositions the microribbons and microfibers display the
               characteristic D-periodicity of approximately 65 nm observed for
               much thicker collagen fibrils. In addition to providing insight
               into the mechanism of collagen assembly, the ultraflat collagen
               matrices may also offer novel ways to bio-functionalize
               surfaces.},

  abstract  = {Cells residing in living tissues apply forces to their immediate
               surroundings to promote the restructuration of the extracellular
               matrix fibres and to transmit mechanical signals to other cells.
               Here we use a minimalist model to study how these forces,
               applied locally by cell contraction, propagate through the
               fibrous network in the extracellular matrix. In particular, we
               characterize how the transmission of forces is influenced by the
               connectivity of the network and by the bending rigidity of the
               fibers. For highly connected fiber networks the stresses spread
               out isotropically around the cell over a distance that first
               increases with increasing contraction of the cell and then
               saturates at a characteristic length. For lower connectivity,
               however, the stress pattern is highly asymmetric and is
               characterised by force chains that can transmit stresses over
               very long distances. We hope that our analysis of force
               transmission in fibrous networks can provide a new avenue for
               future studies on how the mechanical feedback between the cell
               and the ECM is coupled with the microscopic environment around
               the cells.},

@article{Provenzano2006,
  title     = {Collagen fibril morphology and organization: implications for
               force transmission in ligament and tendon},
  author    = {Provenzano, Paolo P and Vanderby, Jr, Ray},
  abstract  = {Connective tissue mechanical behavior is primarily determined by
               the composition and organization of collagen. In ligaments and
               tendons, type I collagen is the principal structural element of
               the extracellular matrix, which acts to transmit force between
               bones or bone and muscle, respectively. Therefore,
               characterization of collagen fibril morphology and organization
               in fetal and skeletally mature animals is essential to
               understanding how tissues develop and obtain their mechanical
               attributes. In this study, tendons and ligaments from fetal rat,
               bovine, and feline, and mature rat were examined with scanning
               electron microscopy. At early fetal developmental stages,
               collagen fibrils show fibril overlap and interweaving, apparent
               fibril ends, and numerous bifurcating/fusing fibrils. Late in
               fetal development, collagen fibril ends are still present and
               fibril bundles (fibers) are clearly visible. Examination of
               collagen fibrils from skeletally mature tissues, reveals highly
               organized regions but still include fibril interweaving, and
               regions that are more randomly organized. Fibril
               bifurcations/fusions are still present in mature tissues but are
               less numerous than in fetal tissue. To address the continuity of
               fibrils in mature tissues, fibrils were examined in individual
               micrographs and consecutive overlaid micrographs. Extensive
               microscopic analysis of mature tendons and ligaments detected no
               fibril ends. These data strongly suggest that fibrils in mature
               ligament and tendon are either continuous or functionally
               continuous. Based upon this information and published data, we
               conclude that force within these tissues is directly transferred
               through collagen fibrils and not through an interfibrillar
               coupling, such as a proteoglycan bridge.},
